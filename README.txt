GENERAL NOTES
=============

This project implements a generic Tree structure in C++ using templates.

* Linux:
To compile the source code under GNU/Linux  a Makefile has been attached.
Just type "make" inside Linux folder and let the magic begin.

* Windows:
A sample project for Visual Studio 2012 has been attached.

Please note that this is the very first version of the tree. Speed optimizations
like copy-on-write and memory-pools will come on future versions.

The most up to date version is the one running under Windows. As soon as I
have some free time I will update the makefile so you guys can use it under
Linux with no problems.

If you find any bugs, please do not hesitate to contact me (:
